Project Created By Ken Bellows and Bethany Clark
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
CSCI-4210 Operating Systems
Professor David Goldschmidt


To compile the entire project, type "make".
To compile just Part 1, type "make main1".
To compile just Part 2, type "make main2".
To conveniently delete all .class files, type "make clean".

NOTE: For some reason, one of the files (we are unsure which) will sporadically compile with the following error:
	Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.
	Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
We have been unable to determine the source of problem, as compiling with -Xlint:unchecked does not render any results.
In fact, compiling again immediately after receiving this error, without making any changes, generally removes the error.
Don't ask us why, because we have no idea. However, it does not affect the workings of the project.
